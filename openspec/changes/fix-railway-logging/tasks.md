# Tasks: Fix Railway Logging

## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Update `appsettings.json` with corrected Serilog configuration (add `Using` and fix `ExpressionTemplate`).
- [x] 1.2 Verify configuration by running the application locally and checking the console output format.

## 2. Validation
- [x] 2.1 Deploy the changes to Railway using `railway up`.
- [x] 2.2 Verify that logs are visible in the Railway "Logs" tab and reflect the latest application activity.
