# Add README

## Summary
Create a comprehensive README.md file for the GitHub repository to provide project documentation, onboarding guidance, and visibility into the monorepo's purpose and structure.

## Motivation
- GitHub repositories without a README appear incomplete and unprofessional
- New contributors need guidance on project structure, setup, and conventions
- The README serves as the landing page for the repository

## Scope
- Create a root-level `README.md` file
- Document the monorepo purpose and structure
- Include setup instructions for developers
- Reference project conventions and tooling
- Maintain compatibility with Railway deployment workflow

## Out of Scope
- Individual service READMEs (can be added per-service later)
- Detailed API documentation
- Badge integrations (CI status, coverage, etc.) - can be added when CI is configured
